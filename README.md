SeleniumTest1 

This program is a simple test of Selenium WebDriver.

It will be an HTML form that takes an input of two numbers and adds, subtracts, multiplies and divides them with a click.

Selenium WebDriver will run and our script will use RSpec to validate the results. 

The initial version will use the Firefox geckodriver.
